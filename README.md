# Bifold README.md

# Summary

Aries Mobile Agent React Native (Bifold) is an open-source mobile Aries client that's part of the [Hyperledger Foundation](https://www.hyperledger.org/), a global ecosystem committed to advancing enterprise-grade blockchain technologies. This project is centered around Verifiable Credentials (VC), using blockchain and best in-class cryptography technology to deliver trusted, secure data exchanges.

Designed with React Native, Bifold offers cross-platform capabilities, supporting a wide range of use-cases and devices. Bifold is built on the Aries Framework Javascript (AFJ), providing a solid foundation for its architecture.

Our aim is to cultivate a collaborative environment, bringing together organizations and individuals to prevent duplicate efforts and to promote shared solutions. By doing so, we hope to accelerate the adoption of VC technology across various sectors.

One of Bifold's key features is its capacity to hold and utilize VCs in the AnonCreds format. We are also diligently working towards supporting other formats, such as W3C, through the AFJ project. This flexibility makes Bifold a versatile tool for complex or specific use-case projects, streamlining the process of initiating and managing VCs.

Join us as we work towards a future where verifiable credentials are easily accessible and widely adopted, enhancing trust and security in the digital world.

# Current Status


Currently, we're updating Bifold's architecture to make it easier to maintain and customize for various use cases. Check out our [design roadmap issue](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-mobile-agent-react-native/issues/754) for more information, and we welcome your feedback.
